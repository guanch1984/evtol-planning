# Problem Statement
Urban air mobility is a fast-emerging field that is poised to revolutionize the transportation industry. Multiple companies across the world contend to bring access to a network of eVTOL aircraft that will allow for intracity travel for the price of an Uber. While the initial economics limit the market and feasibility of the product, as the industry grows, the price point will continue to drop and expand access to broader markets.

When considering the phased growth of an industry, it becomes necessary to determine the right market dynamics to target for initial operations that properly balances growth potential with a high probability of user adoption. The United States is the perfect incubator for such an industry, with the largest cities in America experiencing high-growth in geographically constrained regions. However, not all cities are built equally. Not only do population densities vary city to city, but access to public transportation and traffic congestion change market dynamics.

A nascent industry must pick and choose its launch markets very carefully. As such, this lends itself to an optimization problem.

# Dataset
- Geospatial data of population density
- Locations of airports, heliports, etc.
- Census data for major US cities wealth density
# Methodology
- Clustering of geospatial data to figure out population centers and identify if existing infrastructure can be utilized.
- Simulation of traffic patterns to understand commutes, value proposition, etc.
- Optimization of traffic patterns dependent on wealth
-- Cost per mile vs potential markets
- Identify the best launch locations, the best number of veritiports, and expected profits and growth projections.
